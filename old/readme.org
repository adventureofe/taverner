* Taverner
turn based RPG

Currently creating huge SQLite3 database to store all const information

** Folders
*** assets
all image data will be stored here

images will be used in SDL2
*** c
the final game will be created in C using SDL2 for graphics

SDL2 boilerplate is already in place

Game currently stores sqlite data using linked lists for prototype.

linked lists are not optimal for these tasks but are quick to implement for proof of concept
as opposed to hashmaps
